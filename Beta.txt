Adding in music, adding ammo boxes and health packs, as well as display UI for them

the way the sprites are set up is to have a 3D collider as a child to a 2D sprite, 
thus making the sprites collidable in all direction while they rotate to face the player so it gives off a fake 3D feel despite being pixelated 2D

Adding in enemies which uses the raycast to check if there's obstacle and range to the player.
If the player is in sight they will move to them and shoot projectiles and try to ram the player.

Shooting the enemy 3 times kills it. Killing them all is the winning condition, and dying is the losing condition
